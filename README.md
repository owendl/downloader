#itch.io downloader

I recently made a bundle purchase from [itch.io](https://itch.io) of a [bundle](https://itch.io/b/770/solo-but-not-alone) of solo tabletop roleplaying games. There are 87 games in the bundle without a bulk download option. I could download all of them individually but I decided to use this opportunity to brush up on some web crawling/scraping skills.

My goal in this repo is to build a universal (as much as possible) bulk downloader that I can point to other sites.
